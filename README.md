# Projects

These files are examples of projects I've done in completing coursework. 
<br/>
The number of the classes correspond as follows:
  <br/>104A/B - a series in Numerical Analysis 
  <br/>131 - Data Mining Class
  <br/>
  the python projects are different implementations of theory in numerical analysis.
  <br/> The final project in 131 involved taking a dataset available online from the UCI data repository that tracked the whether a client of a bank defaulted or not on a credit card payment of a certain month, along with various other statistics such as their monthly income, fitting a model onto the available data, and finding which classification model provided the best estimate to whether clients defaulted or not.
<br/> The document of the final project provides a formal write up diving more into detail of the collection process and the methods of analysis
