# Projects

These files are examples of projects I've done in completing coursework. 
<br/>
The number of the classes correspond as follows:
  <br/>104A/B - a series in Numerical Analysis 
  <br/>131 - Data Mining Class
  <br/>
  <br/>
  the python projects are different implementations of theory in numerical analysis, primarily various methods of polynomial interpolation and approximations. The code uses the theory to create graphs and estimate given polynomials, then compares them to the actual values of the polynomials at various points, checking for accuracy and calculating error.
  <br/>
  <br/> The final project in 131 involved taking a dataset available online from the UCI data repository that tracked the whether a client of a bank defaulted or not on a credit card payment of a certain month, along with various other statistics such as their monthly income, fitting a model onto the available data, and finding which classification model provided the best estimate to whether clients defaulted or not.
<br/> The document of the final project provides a formal write up diving more into detail of the collection process and the methods of analysis
